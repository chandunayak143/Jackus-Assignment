## DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE APPLICATION 
  
  # Application Start 
     cd jakus, npm start 

  # Title 
     Interactive User-Managment application

  # Objective
     Build a simple web application where users can view, add, edit, and delete user details from a mock backend API.
    
  # Tech Stack 
      * Use JSONPlaceholder, a free online REST API that you can use for demonstration and test purposes.
      * Specifically, use the '/users' endpoint to fetch and manipulate user data.
      * Fecth the data using axios;
    
  # Funcationality Must Have 
    * Display all users by fetching data from the '/users' endpoint.

    * Allow adding a new user by posting to the '/users' endpoint. (Note: JSONPlaceholder won't actually add the   user, but will simulate a successful response.)

    *Allow editing an existing user. This should involve fetching the current data for a user, allowing for edits, and then putting the updated data back via the API.

    * Allow users to be deleted, by sending a delete request to the API.

    * Handle scenarios where the API request might fail - show an error message to the user in such cases.

  # Gidelines to Develop Project Must Have
    * Use Github Repository 
    * The primary focus should be on functionality. However, a clean UI will be appreciated.
    * use vanilla JavaScript or any JavaScript framework/library of your choice like React, Angular, Vue, etc.
    *Consider using tools like Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests.
    *Ensure the solution is modular and scalable.
    * The Repository shold be well and  organised and easy to read;
    * The appication shold handel all the functionality and erros;
    * Deploy the application on a hosting platform;
